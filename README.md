# CLTV-Prediction-Analysis

::: Please find my Kaggle notebook here: https://www.kaggle.com/blirinddanjolli/cltv-prediction-analysis to run codes together with dataset.

Investments are company’s commitment for better future. Each company has it’s own calculations to determine the amount of investment, direction and time of exposure. Also a lot work should be done to determine which way to promote/advert our next steps. But as economics is here to say, for sharing limited resources to limitless demands; every company also has limited resources to reach certain part of their customers.

But further of reaching them, we need to understand whether they will continue to buy from us. For example who will be our company’s top 10 most valuable customer 2 quarters later; or which ones aren’t buying anymore from our company so we can specify our adverts for them.

Let’s start.

We have one year dataset of a retail gift shop. This analysis will start as if dataset has no null and no minus values. So we have kind of a “half-baked” dataset.

Retail gift shop dataset’s variables are as below:

Invoice — Unique code for bill/invoice

StockCode — Unique code for product

Description — Product name

Quantity — Number of product sold in certain bill

InvoiceDate — Bill date and time

UnitPrice — Price of product

Customer ID — Unique customer ID for each customer

Country — Name of the country where sale occurs

BUSINESS PROBLEM: An e-commerce company wants to predict customers future purchases and determine business investment plan according to predicted data.

DATASET STORY: There is Online Retail II, 2010-2011 sheet file as dataset. Products sold are mostly souvenirs and most of the customers are corporates.
